1. **Pull Requests (PRs):**
   - Pull requests are a core feature of GitHub. They allow contributors to propose changes to a repository. Commits related to a PR are often reviewed, discussed, and merged into the main branch. Learn more about [pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests).

2. **Code Review:**
   - GitHub provides tools for conducting code reviews within pull requests. Reviewers can comment on specific lines of code and request changes or approve the changes. Explore [code review on GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests).

3. **Commit Templates:**
   - You can create custom commit message templates to ensure consistent and informative commit messages. This is particularly useful for teams. Find out how to [use commit message templates](https://docs.github.com/en/github/committing-changes-to-your-project/creating-a-commit-message-template).

4. **Cherry-Picking Commits:**
   - Cherry-picking is the process of selecting specific commits from one branch and applying them to another. GitHub supports cherry-picking to integrate specific changes into different branches. Learn how to [cherry-pick commits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/about-pull-requests#about-cherry-pick-commits).

5. **Commit Status and Checks:**
   - GitHub allows you to integrate various status checks and automated workflows with commits. These checks can be used for continuous integration, code quality, and more. Explore [commit status and checks](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/guides/about-continuous-integration#status-checks).

6. **Rebasing and Interactive Rebase:**
   - You can use Git commands like `git rebase` and `git interactive rebase` to modify commit history, reorder commits, and squash multiple commits into one before pushing changes to GitHub. Learn about [interactive rebase](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/about-git-rebase).

7. **Commit Signing:**
   - GitHub supports commit signing using GPG keys to verify the authenticity of commits. Learn more about [commit signing](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/managing-commit-signature-verification).

8. **Commit Graph Visualization:**
   - GitHub provides a graphical representation of the commit history, making it easier to visualize branch relationships and commit flows. Explore [commit graph visualization](https://docs.github.com/en/github/visualizing-repository-data-with-graphs).

9. **Commit History Blame View:**
   - The blame view allows you to see who last modified a specific line in a file, along with the corresponding commit. It's helpful for tracking changes and understanding code ownership. Learn about [blame view](https://docs.github.com/en/github/managing-files-in-a-repository/inspecting-changes-in-a-file#annotating-a-file-using-blame).

10. **Branch Protection Rules:**
    - You can configure branch protection rules to ensure that certain criteria (like code reviews, status checks, and required approvals) are met before allowing commits to be merged into specific branches. Read about [branch protection](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/about-protected-branches).
